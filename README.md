# PSIRWLS

Parallel Semi-parametric Iterative Re-Weighted Least Squares: A Parallel Support Vector Machine (SVM) solver based on the IRWLS algorithm

Requirements:
=============

This software is implemented in C and requires the following libraries:

 - [OpenMP] (http://openmp.org/wp/) To parallelize the software
 - A Linear Algebra Package that implements the BLAS and Lapack standard routines, this software has been tested with these libraries (you need just one of them):
     - [BLAS] (http://www.netlib.org/blas/) and [LAPACK] (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/)
     - [ATLAS] (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/)
     - [MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl)


Installation Instructions:
=========

External libraries:
________________

An example to install in ubuntu all the libraries that we need is the following (apt-get is command in the debian based linux distributions to install packages):

OPENMP is currently included with the gcc compiler, if gcc is not installed, use the following command line:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential


To install the linear algebra routines use the following command line:

    sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
    sudo apt-get install libblas-dev
    sudo apt-get install libatlas-dev

Compiling:
__________

If you use blas, lapack, atlas:

    make

If you use MKL libraries:

    make USE_MKL=1


If the libraries are not installed in the standard paths you can uncomment and edit the variables INCLUDEPATH and LIBRARYPATH to tell the location.


Running the code:
=================

Training:
________

To train the algorithm and create the model:

    ./PSIRWLS-train [options] training_set_file model_file

training_set_file: Training set in LibSVM format
model_file: File where the classifier will be stored

Options:
* -g Gamma: Set gamma in the radial basis kernel function (default 1)
* -c Cost: Set the SVM Cost (default 1)
* -s Classifier_size: Size of the classifier (default 50)
* -t Number_of_Threads: It is the number of threads in the parallel task (default 1)

Example:

    ./PSIRWLS-train -g 0.001 -c 10 -s 150 -t 4 training_set_file.txt model_file.mod



Test:
_____

To make predictions with the model in a different dataset:

    ./PSIRWLS-predict [options] dataset_file model_file output_file

Options:
* -t Number_of_Threads: It is the number of threads in the parallel task (default 1)
* -l Labeled:  (default 0)
    * 1 if the dataset is labeled (shows accuracy in the screen)
    * 0 if the dataset is unlabeled (only saves predictions in output file)

Example:

    ./PIRWLS-predict -t 4 -l 1 dataset_file.txt model_file.mod output_file.txt

Input file format:
=================

The dataset must be provided in LibSVM format, labeled to train the model and labeled or unlabeled for predictions (using the -l option in the PIRWLS-predict command to tell if the file is labeled or unlabeled):
